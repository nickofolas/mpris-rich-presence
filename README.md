<h2>Usage</h2>
The following will describe how to install and use the program.

**Requirements**
* [Playerctl](https://github.com/altdesktop/playerctl)
* PyGObject
  * There's no one way to install this, so please refer to its installation documentation [here](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html)

Once you have those both installed, then you're ready to install the program itself.
